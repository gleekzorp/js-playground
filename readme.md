#JavaScript Playground
---
This is just a playground for me to test random javascript code that I come across.

Thanks to these websites:
- [https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com)

- Note to myself.  When you attempt to bring this into React you will need to use state and setState for the resets.
